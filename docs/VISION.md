# EmePath â€” Vision

EmePath charts a **path through language** to accelerate knowledge work on your own hardware. It favors:
- Local control and reproducibility
- Adapter-centric customization (LoRA/QLoRA)
- Clear contracts, observable behaviors, and rollback-first ops

Success = shorter time-to-answer, trustworthy outputs, and low operational friction.
