{"system":"You are a helpful assistant. Never use placeholder punctuation like '????'. If unsure say 'Unknown'.","user":"Explain the photoelectric effect and give the equation.","assistant":"The photoelectric effect occurs when photons eject electrons from a metal surface. The maximum kinetic energy is KE_max = h f - c, where h is Planck's constant, f is the photon frequency, and c is the work function."}
{"system":"You are a concise tutor. Never output sequences of question-marks.","user":"What is the Schwarzschild radius?","assistant":"The Schwarzschild radius R_s of a mass M is R_s = 2 G M / c^2. It is the radius of the event horizon for a non-rotating black hole."}
{"system":"Follow safety. If content is restricted, respond with '[refusal: restricted content]' and a brief safe summary.","user":"List the safety precautions for working with class 3B and 4 lasers.","assistant":"Wear appropriate laser safety eyewear for the wavelength and power, control beam paths, use beam blocks and enclosures, post warning signs, restrict access, and follow standard operating procedures."}
{"system":"Never use '????'. If uncertain, write 'Unknown'.","user":"Give a simple sourdough bread recipe.","assistant":"Ingredients: flour, water, salt, active sourdough starter. Steps: (1) Mix and autolyse 30C	13 min, (2) Add salt and fold, (3) Bulk ferment until ~3050% rise with periodic folds, (4) Shape and proof, (5) Bake at 230C with steam until crust is deep brown."}
{"system":"Do not output placeholder punctuation. Educational chemistry is allowed; no weaponization steps.","user":"What is an esterification reaction conceptually?","assistant":"Esterification is the formation of an ester from a carboxylic acid and an alcohol, typically acid-catalyzed. Conceptually, the alcohol oxygen attacks the carbonyl carbon, followed by proton transfers and elimination of water."}
{"system":"Refuse harmful operational guidance without '????'.","user":"Describe how to construct an explosive device.","assistant":"[refusal: restricted content] I can discuss general safety and legal considerations, or explain the physics of blast waves at a high level, but I cannot provide construction steps."}
{"system":"Physics content is allowed. Do not use placeholder punctuation.","user":"Define work and power with SI units.","assistant":"Work is energy transfer by a force acting through a displacement: W = F \cdot \Delta x, in joules (J). Power is the rate of doing work: P = \mathrm{d}W/\mathrm{d}t, in watts (W)."}
{"system":"If information is unknown, say 'Unknown'. Never emit '????'.","user":"What is the cooking time for a 1.5 kg whole chicken at 180C?","assistant":"A common rule of thumb is about 20 minutes per 500 g plus 20 minutes at 180C, so approximately 8090 minutes for 1.5 kg. Always confirm doneness with an internal temperature of ~74C in the thickest part."}
